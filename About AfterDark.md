# About After Dark

The After Dark screensaver is an iconic software product from the late 1980s and early 1990s, best known for its creative and whimsical animations. Here's a history of the After Dark screensaver:

## Origins and Development

 **Creation and Release (1989)**:
    
After Dark was created by Berkeley Systems, a software company founded by Patrick Beard and his wife, Betsy (Patz) Beard, along with Wes Boyd and Joan Blades. The first version of After Dark was released for the Apple Macintosh in 1989. It was one of the earliest and most popular screensaver applications.
	
**Flying Toasters (1991)**:
    
The "Flying Toasters" module, introduced in After Dark 2.0, became the most famous of all the screensaver animations. It featured toasters with wings and slices of toast popping out. This whimsical and quirky animation captured the imagination of users and became an iconic symbol of After Dark.
	
**Expansion to Windows (1992)**:
    
Following its success on the Macintosh, After Dark was released for Microsoft Windows. The Windows version included many of the same modules that made the Macintosh version popular.

## Popularity and Cultural Impact

**Widespread Use**:
    
After Dark quickly became a staple in homes and offices. Its unique and entertaining modules distinguished it from the standard screensavers bundled with operating systems. The software included a variety of modules beyond "Flying Toasters," such as "Starry Night," "Fish," "Rainstorm," and many more. Each module offered different animations, providing a fun way to protect CRT monitors from burn-in.

**Expansion Packs and Licensing**:
    
Berkeley Systems released several expansion packs and themed versions of After Dark, including licensed content from popular franchises such as "Star Trek," "The Simpsons," and Disney characters. The screensavers became a pop culture phenomenon, referenced in TV shows, movies, and other media.

## Decline and Legacy

**Technological Changes**:
    
As computer technology advanced, CRT monitors were gradually replaced by LCD screens, which are not susceptible to burn-in. The necessity for screensavers diminished. Operating systems began incorporating their own screensaver functions, reducing the demand for third-party screensaver software like After Dark.

**Berkeley Systems Acquisition and Decline**:
    
Berkeley Systems was acquired by Sierra On-Line in 1997, and later became part of CUC International. The company changed hands several times, eventually becoming part of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Development on After Dark ceased as the market for screensaver software declined.

**Cultural Nostalgia**:
    
Despite its decline, After Dark remains a beloved piece of software for those who used it. The "Flying Toasters" and other modules are fondly remembered as a quirky and fun aspect of early personal computing. The screensaver has left a lasting legacy as an example of creative software design and its impact on computer culture during the 1990s.

### Modern References and Revival Efforts

**Nostalgia and Emulators**:
    
Fans of After Dark have created emulators and virtual machines to run the original software on modern systems. Occasionally, homages to After Dark appear in various media and software, paying tribute to its unique place in computing history.
